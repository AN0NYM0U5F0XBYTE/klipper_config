## Plans For This Beauty

1. Adding the [Ender Extender 400XL](https://enderextender.com/collections/ender-3-kits-pro/products/ender-extender-400xl-for-ender-3-pro)-kit for a bigger print volume.
2. Adding the necessary [AC Powered 600 watt heat pad](https://enderextender.com/products/ac-powered-600-watt-heat-pad-with-solid-state-relay?variant=31851943821409) and the included SSR.
3. Adding a Relay between The AC Input of the PSU and Power Plug to enable turning the printer on and off via my pi4.
4. Adding a stronger Laser to enable the possibility of laser cutting as by now i can only engrave.
